# Simple Cron

> Dead simple cron service for making HTTP calls on a regular schedule.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/saasify-sh/simple-cron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/saasify-sh/simple-cron) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Features

- üíØ **Open source**
- üôà [Hosted version](https://simple-cron.saasify.sh) provided by [Saasify](https://saasify.sh)
- üôâ Self-hosted version is easy to set up
- üê≥ Built on top of Google Cloud [Scheduler](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler) and [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore)
- üí™ Scales "infinitely" via serverless magic
- üë§ Users can only manage the jobs they own
- ü§ñ Includes an auto-generated OpenAPI spec
- üëç Super simple -- Google does all the hard work for us

## Install

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn
```

```bash
# Configure your google service account and cloud scheduler
# See the Setup section below for more details
echo GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='/path/to/service-account.json' >> .env
echo GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID='XXX' >> .env
echo GOOGLE_PROJECT_LOCATION='XXX' >> .env

# Run the development server
yarn dev

# Or run the production server
yarn build
yarn start
```

## Usage

Now let's set up some useful environment variables for the following examples. We'll be using the local dev server and a fake user named `nala` (my wonderful kitty üòª).

```bash
export SIMPLE_CRON_URL=http://localhost:4000
export SIMPLE_CRON_USER=nala
```

All of the following examples use [httpie](https://httpie.org), a modern alternative to `curl`. They're just normal HTTP REST calls, so feel free to replace them with your preferred REST language / client.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saasify-sh/simple-cron/master/media/cron-syntax.png" alt="Cron expression syntax" width="480" />
</p>

```bash
# Create a new job that will send a GET request to example.com once every minute
http POST ${SIMPLE_CRON_URL}/jobs schedule='* * * * *' url='https://example.com' x-saasify-user:${SIMPLE_CRON_USER}
```

There are two required parameters: `schedule` and `url`.

- `schedule` - (**required** string) A standard [cron expression](https://crontab.guru) describing when your HTTP job should run.
- `url` - (**required** string) The URL to visit each time your job runs.
- `httpMethod` - (string, default `GET`) Optional HTTP method to use. (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `OPTIONS`)
- `httpBody` - (object, default `{}`) Optional JSON body to use.
- `httpHeaders` - (object, default `{}`) Optional HTTP headers to use.
- `httpQuery` - (object, default `{}`) Optional HTTP query parameters to add to the base `url`.
- `timezone` - (string, default `America/New_York`) Optional [time zone](https://cloud.google.com/dataprep/docs/html/Supported-Time-Zone-Values_66194188) to use.
- `name` - (string) Optional metadata name.
- `description` - (string) Optional metadata description .
- `tags` - (string[]) Optional metadata tags .

The output of your newly created job should look something like this:

```json
{
  "id": "sEfyx6mm2d9smI0xltYI",
  "schedule": "* * * * *",
  "url": "https://saasify.sh",
  "userId": "nala",
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "httpMethod": "GET",
  "httpHeaders": {},
  "description": "",
  "name": "Default",
  "tags": [],
  "createdAt": "2020-03-07T19:10:40.119Z",
  "updatedAt": "2020-03-07T19:10:40.119Z"
}
```

Here are some of the ways you can manage your job:

```bash
# Get the job via its id
http GET ${SIMPLE_CRON_URL}/jobs/sEfyx6mm2d9smI0xltYI x-saasify-user:${SIMPLE_CRON_USER}

# Pause the job
http PUT ${SIMPLE_CRON_URL}/jobs/sEfyx6mm2d9smI0xltYI x-saasify-user:${SIMPLE_CRON_USER} state=paused

# Resume the job
http PUT ${SIMPLE_CRON_URL}/jobs/sEfyx6mm2d9smI0xltYI x-saasify-user:${SIMPLE_CRON_USER} state=enabled

# Disable the job
http PUT ${SIMPLE_CRON_URL}/jobs/sEfyx6mm2d9smI0xltYI x-saasify-user:${SIMPLE_CRON_USER} state=disabled

# Delete the job
http DELETE ${SIMPLE_CRON_URL}/jobs/sEfyx6mm2d9smI0xltYI x-saasify-user:${SIMPLE_CRON_USER}
```

## Deploy

Once you have the project working locally, you can deploy it anywhere you want: Heroku, AWS, GCP, etc.

For demonstration purposes, we've included an example of deploying to [ZEIT now](https://zeit.co/now) as a serverless function.

Assuming you have `now` set up locally, you will need to initialize the required environment variables first.

```bash
now secret add -- simple-cron-google-project-id "XXX"
now secret add -- simple-cron-google-project-location "XXX"
now secret add -- simple-cron-google-application-credentials "`base64 /path/to/service-account.json`"
```

Note that the `base64` encoding is a [workaround](https://github.com/zeit/now/issues/749) because the serverless environment won't be able to access the filesystem.

Once your `now` config is set up, you should be able to run:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

You should be gucci now -- go forth and cron, my friend! ‚úåÔ∏è

Be careful to never check your Google service account credentials into version control.

## Setup

#### Google Cloud Firestore

You need to set up a new Firebase project, following the prompts. Once you get to your Firestore database, make sure it's in native mode, not datastore mode so we can access it programatically.

#### Google Cloud Scheduler

You need to enable the Google Cloud Scheduler API in your cloud console and then figure out your project ID and location. For me, these were `saasify` and `us-central1` respectively.

#### Google Service Account

You need to create a new [Google service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started), assign the correct roles, and then download the resulting `json` key file.

The roles I used are `Cloud Scheduler Admin`, `Cloud Scheduler Service Agent`, `Firebase Admin`, `Firebase Develop Admin`, and `Firebase Admin SDK Administrator Service Agent`.

These roles are a bit of a black box and I'm sure it would work with less roles, but this worked for me. If you figure out the minimal set of roles needed, please open an issue to let me know.

#### Misc

If you get permission denied errors along the way, don't worry -- you're in good company üòÇ

Just double check to make sure these APIs are enabled in your Google cloud console and that the service account you're using has the correct roles. If the errors still happen, try waiting a few minutes for the permissions to propagate which ended up working for me.
